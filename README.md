# Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Excel
This is an analysis of a hotel where I try to find the ratio of the cancelation using Excel

In this project, I clear the data using the Power Query editor,
I used the Pivot table to analyze the data, and from there I get 
so many insights.
I took the help of Pivot Charts to make this dashboard.

```Hope You will get a better understanding after seeing the data```
